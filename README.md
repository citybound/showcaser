# showcaser
A webapp to show off your city &amp; create a city journal

Observation: city-building game players love to create beautiful showcases or even development journals of their cities.

Goal: let's build a webapp that specializes in doing that, is tighly integrated with the game and allows easy sharing

# Initial design

**Please discuss in the [showcaser room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/citybound/showcaser)**

## Pages

### City: Introduction

  - Yearly review (Graphs, stats, ...)
